# MeatGrinder

This application is currently hosted using **Google App Engine** at [this address](http://meat-grinder.appspot.com).

## Purpose

[Christian Blouin](https://github.com/bongotastic) and I created this application a couple of years back to manage calculating what body location an attack hits in the GURPS roleplaying system. A thread was maintained [here](http://gurpspalantirquest.blogspot.ca/2013/05/web-app-for-hit-location-and-realistic.html).

This application's source code has been released in leu of an upcoming refactoring and cleaning up of the code in preparation of adding a couple of new features.
