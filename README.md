# MeatGrinder

A web application for the GURPS roleplaying system that calculates a body location that is hit when an attack succeeds in combat, in addition to follow-up effects. A thread was maintained [here](http://gurpspalantirquest.blogspot.ca/2013/05/web-app-for-hit-location-and-realistic.html) to describe this tool.

This application is self-hostable using Docker.

## Authorship

[Christian Blouin](https://github.com/bongotastic) and I created this application some number of years ago. Changes made to update to Python 3.8 and update to a Docker container were made by me later.

## Possible Future Features

  - Transform core to a RESTful API
  - Anything else found in `./TODO.txt`
