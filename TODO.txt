Outstanding issues

Critical:

Important:
- Styling with new color scheme

Good to have/fix:
- It would be neat to gather what gets rolled as a log using the data store. Sortof a relational table with:
    <realistic bool><damage type sting><random bool><body part string>
    
    We could have a statistics page (and a tiny link on the app page) showing the 
        ** proportion by damage type, 
        ** a hit counter, 
        ** breakdown of targetted shots. 
        ** Proportion of  hit using realistic threshold vs basic
        
    It is not very important at all, but I'm curious to see how to interact with data for future app. And the truly geek would
    probably enjoy the stats. If you want to play with that, go ahead. If not, I'll give it a try later.
    
- A java script to toggle between realistic/basic thresholds.


Not sure if it is worth it
-- Implement a more detailed table from Low-Tech Instant Armor (I don't own this manual...)
-- Graphic selector (we're not hot on that)


Fixed:
cb - Crash on adding,multiplying multipliers.
cb - Display of non numerical multiplier.
cb - Added a credit link section.
cb - Remember the last damage type
cb - Abdominal wound sublocations not handled.
cb - Order the Threshold: use a list of [threshold, text] instead of a disctionary
cb - Special Wound tables
cb - Cutting, Face/Nose: multiple "Attacks that miss by..." notes; may have to do a UNIQUE on notes list.

as - Hand foot neck and torso sublocations are not set to valid locations (With no notes mapping to them).
as - Modifier float values properly translated to floats.
as - Styling fixes, changed ordering of location list, cleaning up of code.
